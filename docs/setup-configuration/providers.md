# Providers
A **Provider** is a shipping provider used for shipping your packages. Depending on your shipping needs will determine which service you'd like to use, and currently Postie supports the following providers:

- [Australia Post →](docs:shipping-providers/australia-post)
- [Canada Post →](docs:shipping-providers/canada-post)
- [Fastway →](docs:shipping-providers/fastway)
- [FedEx →](docs:shipping-providers/fed-ex)
- [UPS →](docs:shipping-providers/ups)
- [USPS →](docs:shipping-providers/usps)

Each provider has the following settings available to configure.

## API Settings
Every provider will require different API settings, so this section will change depending on the individual provider. See each [Shipping Provider](docs:shipping-providers) for more details.

## Markup
You can setup a markup for every provider, which is useful to cover packing costs or other incidental costs. You can select this value to be either a _Percentage_ or _Value_.

Choose _Percentage_ if you want to add a markup based of the total order price. Add a markup rate between 1 and 100 to calculate a percentage.

Choose _Value_ if you want to add just a pure value at top of the total order price. For example, "5" for $5 dollars.
